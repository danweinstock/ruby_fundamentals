Ruby Fundamentals 1
=======================

This was my first venture into Ruby programming.  In these four exercises we tried out some basic Ruby concepts
that we would go onto apply later on.
The first exercise was just getting very basic on the truth/false value of some puts statements.
The second exercise was practice with basic math, working with the different data types Ruby can use,
and fun with booleans
Third was our first foray into string interpolation.
The last exercise was running FizzBuzz using Ruby code.
